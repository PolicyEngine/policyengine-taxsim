## Overview

This project provides a high-fidelity emulator for TAXSIM-35, leveraging PolicyEngine's comprehensive US federal and state tax calculator. It enables researchers, analysts, and policymakers to run large-scale tax microsimulations with full compatibility to TAXSIM-35 input/output formats.

### Key Features

- **High-Performance Microsimulation**: Process thousands of households simultaneously using PolicyEngine's vectorized calculations
- **TAXSIM-35 Compatibility**: Full compatibility with TAXSIM input CSV format and output variables
- **Advanced State Handling**: Correctly handles state-specific tax conformity rules (e.g., states that adopt federal AGI vs federal taxable income)
- **Comprehensive Comparison Tools**: Side-by-side comparison of PolicyEngine vs TAXSIM results with detailed mismatch analysis
- **Interactive Dashboard**: React-based dashboard for exploring results across years, states, and household characteristics
- **Flexible Output Options**: Standard, full, and text description output formats matching TAXSIM specifications
- **YAML Test Generation**: Generate PolicyEngine test cases for reproducibility and validation

## Quick Start

   ```

5. To update dependencies used by the project (for existing project):
   ```bash
   pip install -e . --upgrade
   ```

### From GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-taxsim.git
```

## Usage

The CLI provides several commands for different use cases. All commands are accessed through the main CLI interface:

```bash
python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```

### PolicyEngine Calculations

Calculate taxes using PolicyEngine:

```bash
python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py policyengine your_input_file.csv
```

**Options:**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--output`, `-o` | Specify the output file path (default: output.txt) |
| `--logs` | Generate PolicyEngine YAML Tests Logs |
| `--disable-salt` | Set State and Local Sales or Income Taxes used for the SALT deduction to 0 |
| `--sample N` | Sample N records from input for testing |

**Example:**
```bash
python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py policyengine input.csv --output results.csv --logs --sample 1000
```

### TAXSIM Calculations

Run native TAXSIM-35 calculations:

```bash
python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py taxsim your_input_file.csv
```

**Options:**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--output`, `-o` | Output file path (default: taxsim_output.csv) |
| `--sample N` | Sample N records from input |
| `--taxsim-path` | Custom path to TAXSIM executable |

**Example:**
```bash
python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py taxsim input.csv --output taxsim_results.csv
```

### Comparison Analysis

Run comprehensive side-by-side comparisons between PolicyEngine and TAXSIM:

```bash
python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py compare your_input_file.csv
```

**Options:**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--output-dir` | Directory for comparison results (default: comparison_output) |
| `--year` | Override tax year for calculations |
| `--sample N` | Sample N records for comparison |
| `--disable-salt` | Disable SALT deduction in PolicyEngine |
| `--logs` | Generate PolicyEngine YAML test logs |

The comparison uses a $15 tolerance for both federal and state tax comparisons, which accounts for reasonable rounding differences.

**Examples:**

Basic comparison:
```bash
python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py compare cps_households.csv --sample 1000
```

Year-specific analysis with detailed logging:
```bash
python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py compare input.csv --year 2023 --logs --sample 5000
```

**Output Files:**
- `comparison_results_YYYY.csv` - Consolidated results with both PolicyEngine and TAXSIM outputs for each household
- Console output with match statistics and summary

The consolidated output includes (by default):
- All input variables for each household
- Complete TAXSIM output variables
- Complete PolicyEngine output variables  
- Match/mismatch indicators for federal and state taxes
- State codes for easy filtering
- **All mismatches are automatically included** - no separate mismatch files needed

### Data Sampling

Extract a sample from large datasets:

```bash
python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py sample-data input.csv --sample 1000
```

**Options:**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--sample N` | Number of records to sample |
| `--output`, `-o` | Output file (auto-generated if not specified) |

## Dashboard

The project includes a comprehensive React-based interactive dashboard for visualizing and exploring tax calculation comparisons across multiple years and states.

### Dashboard Setup

1. **Navigate to the dashboard directory:**
   ```bash
   cd cps-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

### Dashboard Features

- **Multi-Year Analysis**: Compare results across tax years 2021-2024 with year-over-year trends
- **State-by-State Breakdown**: Detailed analysis by all 50 US states plus DC
- **Interactive Filtering**: Advanced filtering by state, match status, and household characteristics
- **Variable-Level Comparisons**: Drill down to see differences in specific tax variables (v10, v32, etc.)

### Data Management

The dashboard loads comparison data from `public/data/YYYY/comparison_results_YYYY.csv` files. To update:

1. **Generate new comparison data:**
   ```bash
   python policyengine_taxsim/cli.py compare your_data.csv --year 2024
   ```

2. **Copy results to dashboard:**
   ```bash
   cp comparison_output/comparison_results_2024.csv cps-dashboard/public/data/2024/
   ```

3. **Restart dashboard** to load new data

**Production Build:**
```bash
npm run build
```

The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for researchers and analysts to explore large-scale tax calculation comparisons without requiring technical expertise.
